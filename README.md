# Hands-On Cloud Development with WildFly
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Cloud Development with WildFly](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-cloud-development-wildfly?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786462374), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The mission of the book is to make you familiar with the tools that you can use to develop
and deploy Java EE applications in the cloud. You will be led through the whole application
development process: creating the application, deploying in the cloud, configuring
Continuous Integration, and secure and fault-tolerant communication between the created
services. As a result, you will gain practical knowledge of Java EE cloud development,
which you can use as a reference for your further projects.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
package org.packt.swarm;
import javax.ws.rs. GET;
import javax.ws.rs. Path;
import javax.ws.rs. Produces;
```

This book assumes that you are familiar with Java EE technology. Although we will be
briefly reminding what Java EE constructs do in the examples, they won't be explained in
detail.
The code repository contains the examples from all the chapters. In order to help you
navigate through them, the examples are indexed from within the chapters.
